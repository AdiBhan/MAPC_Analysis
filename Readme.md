# Data Analysis Phase

## Summer 2023 Cybersecurity Internship at MAPC

During my Summer 2023 Cybersecurity internship at MAPC, I had the opportunity to work on a project focused on analyzing data across vendors in Massachusetts to identify the most at-risk communities and provide targeted outreach. This all ended in a end of semester whitepaper to synthesize our findings, and benefit which can be found here - ()

To accomplish this, I developed and utilized various tools and techniques:

- Created multiple scripts to extract, analyze and store data for over 85 NERAC muncipalities in the Massachusetts region, enabling me to generate insightful graphs and PDF reports.
    - Stored data in MongoDB Atlas Database, and created visuals and graphs for the whitepaper using MongoDB Charts
    - Leveraging the power of UpGuard's Public API, I integrated data analysis with their platform, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our findings.
- I conducted manual analysis using Excel, further refining the results and ensuring comprehensive insights.
- Additionally, I researched and explored solutions to common cybersecurity threats, expanding my knowledge and contributing to the project's overall effectiveness.



This internship experience allowed me to apply my cybersecurity skills in a real-world scenario and contribute to impactful initiatives. It also enhanced my proficiency in data analysis, scripting, and researching cybersecurity issues.

I am excited to share the outcomes and lessons learned from this project through my GitHub repository. Feel free to explore the scripts, files, and reports available there.
